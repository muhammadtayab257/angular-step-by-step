<h1 class="text-center">Component Life Cycle Hook</h1>
<p>The life cycle hooks are the methods that angular invokes on directives and components as it creates, changes, and
  destroys them. Using life-cycle hooks we can fine-tune the behavior of our components during creation, update, and
  destruction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Component Life Cycle
  </li>
  <li>OnInit & OnDestroy</li>
  <li> DoCheck</li>
  <li> Onchanges</li>
</ul>
