<p class="">The data entry forms can be very simple to very complex. The Forms contain large no of input fields, a
  variety of fields like Text boxes, Dates, Numbers, Emails, Password, Check Boxes, Option boxes, etc. These fields can
  Span multiple tabs or multiple pages. Forms may also contain complex validation logic interdependent on multiple
  fields.</p>

<p class="">The Angular forms modules are designed to handle all of the above and a lot more. The Angular Forms now
  supports Reactive forms approach to Forms development. The older way of Template-based approach is also supported</p>
