  <h4>What are Reactive Forms?</h4>
  <p>
    Reactive forms are forms where we define the structure of the form in the
    component class. I,e we create the form model with Form Groups, Form
    Controls, and Form Arrays. We also define the validation rules in the
    component class. Then, we bind it to the HTML form in the template. This is
    different from the template-driven forms, where we define the logic and
    controls in the HTML template.
